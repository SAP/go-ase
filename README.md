# go-ase

## Description

`go-ase` is a driver for the [`databasq/sql`][pkg-database-sql] package
of [Go (golang)][go] to provide access to SAP ASE instances.
It is delivered as Go module.

SAP ASE is the shorthand for [SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise][sap-ase],
a relational model database server originally known as Sybase SQL
Server.

`go-ase` currently contains one implementation in [cgo] in the directory
`cgo`. A pure go driver is planned.

[cgo][cgo] enables Go to call C code and to link against shared objects.

## Requirements

### cgo

The `cgo` driver requires the shared objects from either the ASE itself
or Client-Library to compile.

The required shared objects from ASE can be found in the installation
path of the ASE under `OCS-16_0/lib`, where `16_0` is the version of
your ASE installation.

After [installing the Client-Library SDK][cl-sdk-install-guide] the
shared objects can be found in the folder `lib` at the chosen
installation path.

The headers are provided at `cgo/includes`.

## Download and Usage

The packages in this repo can be `go get` and imported as usual.

For specifics on how to use `database/sql` please see the
[documentation][pkg-database-sql].

### cgo Usage

Example code:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/SAP/go-ase/cgo"
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("ase", "ase://user:pass@host:port/")
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to open database: %v", err)
        return
    }
    defer db.Close()

    err = db.Ping()
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to ping database: %v", err)
        return
    }
}
```

`/path/to/OCS` is the path to your Client-Library SDK installation.
`/lib` is the folder inside of the SDK installation containing the
shared objects required for the cgo driver.

Compilation:

```sh
CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/OCS/lib" go build -o cmd ./
```

Execution:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/OCS/lib" ./cmd
```

### Examples

More examples can be found in the folder `examples/$type`, where `$type`
is either `go` or `cgo`.

### Unit tests

Unit tests for the packages are included in their respective directories
and can be run using `go test`.

### Integration tests

Integration tests are available in `tests/` and can be run using `go test test/${type}test`,
where `$type` is either `go` or `cgo`.

These require the following environment variables to be set:

- `ASE_HOST`
- `ASE_PORT`
- `ASE_USER`
- `ASE_PASS`

The cgo tests additionally require the variable `ASE_USERSTOREKEY` to be set.

The integration tests will create new databases for each connection type to run tests
against. After the tests are finished the created databases will be removed.

## Configuration

The configuration is handled through either a data source name (DSN) in
one of two forms or through a configuration struct passed to a connector.

All of these support additional properties which can tweak the
connection, configuration options in Client-Library or the drivers
themselves.

### Data Source Names

#### URI DSN

The URI DSN is a common URI like `ase://user:pass@host:port/?prop1=val1&prop2=val2`.

DSNs in this form are parsed using `url.Parse`.

#### Simple DSN

The simple DSN is a key/value string: `username=user password=pass host=hostname port=4901`

Values with spaces must be quoted using single or double quotes.

Each member of `libase.libdsn.DsnInfo` can be set using any of their
possible json tags. E.g. `.Host` will receive the values from the keys
`host` and `hostname`.

Additional properties are set as key/value pairs as well: `...
prop1=val1 prop2=val2`. If the parser doesn't recognize a string as
a json tag it assumes that the key/value pair is a property and its
value.

Similar to the URI DSN those property/value pairs are purely additive.
Any property that only recognizes a single argument (e.g. a boolean)
will only honour the last given value for a property.

#### Connector

As an alternative to the string DSNs `cgo.NewConnector` accepts
a `libdsn.DsnInfo` directly and returns a `driver.Connector`, which can be
passed to `sql.OpenDB`:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"

    "github.com/SAP/go-ase/libase/libdsn"
    ase "github.com/SAP/go-ase/cgo"
)

func main() {
    d := libdsn.NewDsnInfo()
    d.Host = "hostname"
    d.Port = "4901"
    d.Username = "user"
    d.Password = "pass"

    connector, err := ase.NewConnector(*d)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to create connector: %v", err)
        return
    }

    db, err := sql.OpenDB(connector)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to open database: %v", err)
        return
    }
    defer db.Close()

    err = db.Ping()
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to ping ASE: %v", err)
    }
}
```

Additional properties can be set by calling `d.ConnectProps.Add("prop1",
"value1")` or `d.ConnectProps.Set("prop2", "value2")`.

### Properties

#### cgo

##### cgo-callback-client

Recognized values: `yes` or any string

When set to `yes` all client messages will be printed to stderr.

Please note that this is a debug property - for logging you should
register your own message handler with the `GlobalClientMessageBroker`.

When set to any other string the callback will not bet set.

##### cgo-callback-server

Recognized values: `yes` or any string

When set to `yes` all server messages will be printed to stderr.

Please note that this is a debug property - for logging you should
register your own message handler with the `GlobalServerMessageBroker`.

When set to any other string the callback will not be set.

## Limitations

### Unsupported ASE data types

Currently the following data types are not supported:

- Timestamp
- Unichar
- Univarchar
- Text
- Unitext

### Null types in cgo

Due to the limitations of the Client-Library it is not possible to
support null types.

Additionally columns of the following data types must be nullable:

- Image
- Binary
